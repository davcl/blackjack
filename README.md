# blackjack

This code is used to study the dynamics of the blackjack card game. It's going to start with just one deck and try to find analytic probabilities of each scenario. Then we'll expand to card counting and hopefully learning (well, it's probably not groundbreaking stuff, but it's new to me) some simple counting techniques using reinforcement learning.
